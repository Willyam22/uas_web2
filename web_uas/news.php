                <h3>Wout van Aert takes second and world champion Tom Pidcock third</h3>
                <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EUKBwMiErDB98MUkJ2Q62b-1200-80.jpg.webp" alt="gambar Medea Benjamin" style="width: 100%;">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mathieu van der Poel(Alpecin-Deceuninck) came out on
                    top in a battle of
                    the 'big three' at the UCI World Cup in Gavere to take his third win
                    of the season.
                </p>

                <p>The Dutchman beat out long-time rival Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) in a back-and-forth race, with the
                    Belgian taking
                    second at 27 seconds. World champion Tom Pidcock (Ineos Grenadiers) rounded out the podium at 54
                    seconds.</p>

                <p>"I just really wanted to win. Like I said in Mol [second place – Ed.] I wasn't really satisfied. I
                    was determined to do
                    a good result today," Van der Poel said after his win.</p>

                <p>"I think a lot of factors. I think this course is really hard and also technical. I think for me at
                    least it was a
                    pretty nice race. I enjoyed it, lots of people, and I'm happy with my victory."</p>
                <p>Van der Poel had hit the front of the race along with Pidcock inside the first two minutes of the
                    race, though it
                    wouldn't be a straightforward win for the Dutchman, even if Van Aert was stuck further back after
                    the start.</p>

                <p>"Actually, for me, I never felt like being in the mix for victory today," Van Aert said. "From the
                    start, I was chasing.
                    I was never in the rhythm I wanted to have. I must be happy today with second place. It was the
                    highest possible for me.</p>

                <p>"It was still a really nice day out. There were so many crowds, and it was like a World Championships
                    atmosphere. Even
                    though the legs weren’t really responding from the beginning, I still fought because of the fans and
                    yeah, it was a
                    really nice ’cross race."</p>

                <p>He and Pidcock made their way into the lead two spots through the opening lap, while Van Aert
                    eventually battled his way
                    through the pack into third place. But early on lap two, it was Pidcock solo in the lead after Van
                    der Poel suffered a
                    puncture.</p>

                <p>The Briton enjoyed a 10-second lead heading into lap three as Van der Poel and Van Aert co-operated
                    in the chase. He
                    wouldn't be racing off into the distance, though, as his decision to ride up the mid-lap hill while
                    his rivals ran saw
                    him shed time and – on the third lap – lose his lead as the two chasers caught back up.</p>
                <p>"I'm maybe a little bit disappointed," Pidcock said after the race. "It was a very heavy race. The
                    last few laps I
                    really felt it, especially during the running sections. I was struggling to clip back in afterwards.
                    Just not strong
                    enough, really.</p>

                <p>When asked if he thought he could win, Pidcock said the thought crossed his mind when he caught Van
                    der Poel.</p>
                <p>"But then, like I said, on the running sections, my bike was getting heavier and heavier every lap.
                    It felt like I was
                    carrying a car on my shoulder. I wish my bike had an engine, like a car. In the last few laps, my
                    legs fell off a bit."</p>

                <p>It wasn't long before Van der Poel was out in front on his own again, the former four-time world
                    champion edging away
                    from Van Aert and Pidcock to go solo.</p>
                <p>At the start of lap four of six, Van der Poel was 15 seconds up the road, though the chasing pair
                    were able to close to
                    within a handful of seconds as they looked to set up a big, late battle for the win.</p>
                <p>Pidcock did manage to make it across briefly, though Van der Poel discovered a second wind late on to
                    distance both him
                    and Van Aert for good. Pidcock faded late to cede second place to Van Aert, while outside the 'big
                    three' battle it was
                    Michael Vanthourenhout (Pawels Sauzen-Bingoal) who was best of the rest, albeit almost two minutes
                    down.
                </p>
